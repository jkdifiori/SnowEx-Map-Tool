# SnowEx Data Set Map Tool

## Building a Map-Based Tool for Cross-Referencing SnowEx Data Sets

This project aims to build a map-based tool which will be available on the NSIDC website to help users better find related SnowEx data sets.

### The problem

Published SnowEx data sets are currently searchable on the NSIDC website. The data is organized by data set title and can be filtered by campaign year. Broadly geographic information about each data set is available, i.e., "Farmer's Loop" or "Grand Mesa". However, there is currently no way to know which data sets contain data for specific snow pits without individually downloading and opening each data file. This project aims to make cross-referencing related SnowEx data sets simpler by building a map-based tool. Ideally this tool will show locations of all data collection (snow pit or otherwise), with linked information to the relevant data sets.

## Data and Methods

### Data

We will be working with published SnowEx 23 campaign data available from NSIDC. https://nsidc.org/data/snowex/data?field_data_set_keyword_value=5

### Existing methods

During the 2023 campaign, a simple ArcGIS online map was constructed to track snow pit progress each data. This prompted the idea for creating a more functional map that could be used to improve data access. https://arcg.is/0Diiq

### Proposed methods/tools

Prior to the Hackweek, the initial idea for building this tool was to create a more complex and functional ArcGIS map that could be embedded into the NSIDC website. The Hackweek presents the opportunity to crowdsource potentially better options. Can the process be automated? Are there more functional web-based mapping tools available? 

## Project goals and tasks

### Project goals

* Learn from SnowEx data users what functionalitites they would like to see in the map-tool
* Determine the best process for building the map-tool
* Build a small-scale version that can be tested by SnowEx Users and then demonstrated to NSIDC
* Plan a course of action for after the Hackweek

### Tasks TBD

What are the individual tasks or steps that need to be taken to achieve each of the project goals identified above? What are the skills that participants will need or will learn and practice to complete each of these tasks? Think about which tasks are dependent on prior tasks, or which tasks can be performed in parallel.

* Task 1 (all team members will learn to use GitHub)
* Task 2 (team members will use the scikit-learn python library)
  * Task 2a (assigned to team member A)
  * Task 2b (assigned to team member B)
* Task 3
* ...
